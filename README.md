# GamifyHSE

A final objective of the project is development of a client app for SmartLMS with gamification elements used to track the development of students' skills.
The app is expected to be used to conduct further research on the topic of applying gamification elements in academic environment of HSE University.
It is assumed that introduction of game-design elements into SmartLMS will increase students’ involvement into the academic environment, increase their motivation to complete assignments on time, and ultimately lead to an improvement in the quality of students’ work. After finalizing results of research on effectiveness of such an approach, it is proposed to introduce gaming elements directly into the learning process.
